Comment Practicum Project
The solution is provided in two parts: the python juipter notebook and the Tableau dashboard. Both parts of the deliverable are housed in the Github repository at URL. The python notebook can be run in any python notebook environment whether that is with cloud computing with a platform such as Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services or a local environment on oneâ€™s own machine. The notebook will need to be pointed to the latested data file for updated results in the second code block in the notebook. (One note is that if this notebook is being run for the first time in a new environment, there could be python packages that may need to be installed before a successful run.) After running the notebook, one opens the Tableau dashboard file and uses the CSV files as the data source in Tableau. Then, the dashboard is ready to be socialized among the Commnet team to gather insights about the service.
